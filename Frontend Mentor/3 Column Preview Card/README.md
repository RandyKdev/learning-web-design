## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS FLex Box
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM CSS Naming Convention

### What I learned

- Using Outlines instead of Borders because outlines don't contribute or disturb the flow of the document. Its only for visual effects and does not affect the size of the element.
- Using box shadows instead of Outlines so as to get the rounded nature of the buttons as outlines couldn't be rounded
- Hiding contents visually, but can accessed by screen readers for accessibility purposes
- Using the css style, `overflow: hidden;` in cases where the parent's border radius should affect all children 

### Continued development

I would dive deeper into Sematic HTML  and CSS Best Practices
